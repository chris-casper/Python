# Python Scripts

## ATP-1.0.6-sanitized.py

Simple geotranscription python script. It uses Google's geocoder API to take business names and get the most probable physical address for said business. It works about 95% of the time, so the output should be reviewed. The errata is usually if businesses have multiple locations, it will give the main address.

I wrote this for a sales department to organize their customer locations. I often put the output into a KMZ file that they found very handy
